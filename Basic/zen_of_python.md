# [Zen Of Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_of_Python)

`Zen Of Python`은 [Timsort hybrid sorting algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort)의 개발자이자 Python의 major contributor인 [Tim Peters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Peters_(software_engineer))가 Python언어의 디자인에 영향을 미친 소프트웨어 개발을 위한 **19가지 원칙**을 정리해놓은 것이다. `Time Peters`는 20번째 원칙은 `Guido`에게 채우라고 남겨두었지만 아직까지 채워지지 않고 있다.  

`Zen Of Python`은 [PEP 20 -- The Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/)에 공식적으로 포함되었다. 또한 Python Interpreter의 Easter egg로 포함되었는데 다음 명령을 통해 확인할 수 있다.

## The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

* Beautiful is better than ugly.
* Explicit is better than implicit.
* Simple is better than complex.
* Complex is better than complicated.
* Flat is better than nested.
* Sparse is better than dense.
* Readability counts.
* Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
* Although practicality beats purity.
* Errors should never pass silently.
* Unless explicitly silenced.
* In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
* There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
* Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
* Now is better than never.
* Although never is often better than *right* now.
* If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
* If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
* Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
